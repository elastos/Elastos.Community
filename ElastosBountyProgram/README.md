# Elastos Bounty Program (EBP) - Will Undergo a Rebrand

Previous documentation can be found here [EBP.md](./EBP.md)

## The new name will likely be released this week and this documentation will be updated

For now we will still refer to this project as the EBP project.

A general simplification has been done, there are now two main programs to earn ELA,

1. The Developer EBP Program

    As a developer there are training related events and also tasks such as writing tutorials,
    example apps/demos or fixing bugs. We also accept submissions of bugs, issues or security
    issues which will be reviewed and possibly turned into tasks and the submitter of the issue
    rewarded with ELA.

2. The Community EBP Program

    Anyone and also developers alike can participate in the community program which rewards
    organizers who host events or do tasks that promote Elastos in their community and online.
