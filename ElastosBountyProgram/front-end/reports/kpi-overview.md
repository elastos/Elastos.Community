# KPI Overview

#### The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) demonstrate the value that Cyber Republic brings to the Elastos Ecosystem.

?> For a higher-level overview of Cyber Republic please reference the [full documentation](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/docs)

The KPIs are grouped into three categories:

## Development KPIs

#### 1. Developer Count

This should be granular and broken down into disciplines and experience level

**Disciplines**
- Front-End - focused on Javascript skills and we expect NodeJS knowledge
- Mobile - native mobile experience (Android/Swift) and/or React Native
- Back-End -

**Experience Level**
- Senior Experience Level
- Junior Experience Level - 1-3 years of experience

#### 2. Pivotal Tracker Velocity (Weekly) - across all projects

This is our agile/sprint project management software. It uses a common fibonacci point scheme for task difficulty:

For individual tasks the points correspond to the following time to complete:
- 1 = 15-30 minutes
- 2 = 1-2 hours
- 3 = one day (5-7 hours)
- 5 = 2-3 days
- 8 = 3-5 days
- 13 = a week

Generally a full-time developer should average 15-18 points a week, so a velocity of 50 would correspond to 3 developers

#### 3. Bugs/Issues Opened and Closed per Week

#### 4. Pull Requests per Week
